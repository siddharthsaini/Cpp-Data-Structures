# twenty

Today marks a day like any other,\
But I decide to mark it unlike any other.\
This is as far as my neurons can get,\
So I reaaaally hope this poem makes you wet :D\
\
Another year has come,\
Another age has begun,\
Another new chapter to be done.\
\
It's so beautiful when you're around,\
Similar to when the heavy rains surround.\
The drops blind me from looking around for long,\
Pleasant ambience and it's petrichor caresses like a song.\
\
But just you wait till this fuss gets over,\
We'll sing, eat, drink and dine and end our reunion with a heavy hangover.\
But seriously, all jokes aside,\
When anyone frowns,\
You turn it upside down.\
To you, it's just a regular vibe,\
For us, issa-kawai-delight.\
\
Now as your birthday is showing its end,\
But before it does,\
Close your eyes and think of your family and friends.\
Who'll always be with you however and wherever you are,\
Even if you're not on this planet or beyond any star.\
\
I apologise for sending this sooo late at eleven-o-two,\
But hey, endings can often be beautiful too!\
\
Happy Birthday Pari, congratulations on turning 20!\
~ With love, Siddarth ❤️
